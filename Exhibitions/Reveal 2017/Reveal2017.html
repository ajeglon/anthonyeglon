<!--About Exhibition--> 
<div>
    <p class="exhtext">Reveal was my Final Degree Show for my Fine Art BA(Hons) course. In this exhibition I displayed a range of floor sculptures named “”. These sculptures were intended to entice the viewers in hopefully tempting them to touch said sculptures, they also acted as further gallery viewers as they were looking at a range of wall sculptures also displayed in the exhibition.</p>
</div>
<!--Artist Statement-->

    <h3 class="exhtitle">Artist Statement</h3>
    <p class="exhtext">How then do you begin to interact when the viewers have turned into sculptures? Do you begin to focus your attention on the sculptures, which in turn view the flaccid objects? Let your mind accept that these sculptures are nothing more than just remote viewers and therefore the focus lies purely on the wall mounted objects. Perhaps the pieces are connected? But in what way could they be? Angular, large sculptures in quasi figurative form relate to modernist sculpture, yet, they are lumpy and the colours are a bit strange, they’re pastel, not strong and dominating, like stone or bronze. There is no steel armature but instead, this soft, smooth looking surface, it looks pleasurable to touch, but you can’t so that is a shame. But some even look different in texture, one looks a bit crystaline, so maybe that’s not as nice to touch, but what if they’re soft crystals? </p>
    <p class="exhtext">Soft crystals?</p>
    <p class="exhtext">…is that even a thing?</p>
    <p class="exhtext">…but all this talk of forms and textures seems to have gotten away from the wall objects, so maybe we should go back to them? After all they are what all the sculptures are pointing towards. They themselves are viewing these objects, and so why are you paying more attention to these “gallery visitors”? Again we’re getting off track, so yes, the wall objects. Finally we can talk about the wall objects, ah one’s on the floor in the corner over there but let’s not let that distract us any further. </p>
    <p class="exhtext">So, these objects let’s have a look at what’s around here, so they’re pretty easy to identify, we’ve got a hammer over there, looks like that wouldn’t be the handiest thing in the world though, and there’s actually another kind of hammer here as well, would you describe as more of a mallet? There’s a couple of smoking pipes, they’re different colours to the hammers, and maybe they’re made of different materials? Maybe they’re just coloured differently. There’s also a bottle of some sort, looks alcoholic to me,  vodka, whiskey, maybe rum? Who knows, does it matter? Nope. </p>
    <p class="exhtext">All this talk of a bottle and you forgot about the last object, come on don’t let your mind wander too much we’re nearly done. So it’s one of those tools you use for sealing your bathroom, silicon gun or something right? Yeah, but it’s a bit floppy and it looks like it couldn’t even hold its own weight. Then again they all seem to be a bit like that, a collection of droopy objects, what’s wrong with them? Are they trying to escape the gaze of the sculptures? Are they embarrassed because they are the focal points? But are they the focal points? </p>
    <p class="exhtext">No, you’re overthinking it… perhaps the best way to look at this work, would be the same way you’d go about it in any other exhibition, why don’t you go over to one of the viewers who’s had a chance to absorb the work and discuss it with them, there’s seven in total so have your pick, I’d pick Franz personally, he articulates like no other, Constantin over there though, he’s a bit of an arsehole, just keeps making remarks of how art’s just a bunch of floppy...</p>
